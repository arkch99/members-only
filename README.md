# members-only
A members-only message board featuring user authentication. Unregistered users get to see all messages posted, but without knowing who posted them and when. Registering allows users to post messages to the board, but still hides user information. Entering a secret passcode makes users "members" of the community, finally letting them see who their fellow members are, and what they post.
